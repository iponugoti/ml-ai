This repository contains the code for all of my MLTA project 2 using text analysis methods. It contains 2 main notebooks:

1. MLTA Project 2 - Import and Clean Data: this contains my code for scraping Tech Crunch headlines, scraping the articles to get the keyword tags, and assigning industries to each article. I compile this information into a pandas dataframe and save it as techcrunch_articles.csv for future use. 
2. MLTA Project 2 - Stats and Model: this contains my code for my descriptive analysis of the dataframe that I previously constructed. After conducting an initial EDA, I conduct a sentiment analysis and do some additional data analysis.
